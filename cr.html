        <p>Jamuna parasad like any service available in an open marketplace, massage therapy services run the
            spectrum
            not-so-good
            to exceptional. If you’ve ever received a professional massage from more than one therapist, you’ll
            notice
            difference in their approach to massage, their training, and how effective the treatment is. A truly
            professional massage therapist delivers a truly professional massage.

            So is your therapist a true professional? Are you getting the best massage therapy service you can get?
            Here
            are
            ten signs, in no particular order, that you’re probably working with the best. Does your massage
            therapist
            measure up?


            Licensed & educated. Like any profession, massage therapy is regulated. There are education and testing
            requirements that vary by state. Working with a licensed and certified therapist ensures your therapist
            has
            the
            knowledge and skills to keep you safe, respect your boundaries, and work within their scope of practice.
            Look
            for a certificate posted in the place of business. It should be issued in their name, from a reputable
            certification body. In California, it’s the California Massage Therapy Council, for example. You can
            usually
            go
            online to your state’s licensing or certifying body and search for the name of your therapist to verify
            certification if you have a question.
            There should also be a business license present at the place of business. That license allows them to
            legally
            work in the city and/or county of the practice. In most cases liability insurance is also required,
            provided
            either by the company a therapist works for, or personally obtained by each therapist. If you ever have
            any
            doubts, just ask your therapist about their training and licensing. They will be glad to talk about
            their
            hard-earned credentials. If you get the runaround, go elsewhere.
            Clean and safe location. Massage therapy locations should be squeaky clean and in a location that is
            safe
            for
            clients. Linens should be disinfected and changed after every use. Massage creams, lotions and gels
            should
            be
            stored in clean containers and should be non-allergenic. Rooms should be dust-free. The only smells
            around
            are
            those of purposeful aromatherapy.
            If the therapist works outside of an office, at an event or they come to your
